# HOSPITAL_ANALYSIS
In this project of mine, i have taken a dataset from KAGGLE and analysed it in MYSQL. The dataset from a hospital contains the patients list who are under antibiotic medications.
It is differentiated under columns such as age, gender, drug name, dosage in grams, diagnosis, indications, time of entry, date of entry.
